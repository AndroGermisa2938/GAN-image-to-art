# I’m Something of a Painter Myself - Mini-project

This repository serves as a submission for the Introduction To Deep Learning course week 4 project. The prompt for the project was to participate in the [I’m Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/overview) Kaggle challenge. The goal was to create a GAN for transforming real images into Monet-style paintings.

This repository contains the Jupiter Notebook with my work for the project, as well as a screenshot of the result of my submission.
